Kubernetes Image Pulling — FAQ (Read Before You Panic)

Q1: Why does docker pull work on my laptop but my Pod still fails?

Short answer: Your laptop is not the Kubernetes node.

Long answer:
When Kubernetes starts a Pod, the node (EC2 VM / GCE VM) pulls the image — not your laptop and not kubectl.
Your laptop credentials are irrelevant unless you copied them into Kubernetes (imagePullSecret).

Rule: If the node can’t pull the image, the Pod will never start.

Q2: Who actually pulls the image in Kubernetes?

The node. Always.
More precisely:
kubelet on the node tells the container runtime (containerd/docker) to pull the image.
The registry only sees the node’s identity (or credentials you gave Kubernetes).
Pods do not talk to registries directly.

Q3: What identity does the node use to pull images?

That depends on the cluster setup:

EKS: the EC2 node’s IAM role
GKE: the node pool’s service account

Any cluster: an imagePullSecret if configured
This identity must have permission to read from the registry.

Q4: What is ImagePullBackOff really telling me?

It means:
“The node tried to pull the image and failed.”

Common reasons:
image name or tag doesn’t exist
registry requires authentication
node does not have permission
wrong registry URL

It is not a Kubernetes bug and not a YAML syntax problem.

Q5: Do I need docker login on my laptop?
Only for local testing.

docker login:

helps you verify the image exists
helps you test credentials locally

It does nothing for Kubernetes unless you turn it into an imagePullSecret.

Q6: When do I need an imagePullSecret?

You need one when:
the registry is private
the node identity does not have access
you’re pulling from an external or third-party registry
you don’t control node IAM (common in shared clusters)

You usually do not need one in:
EKS → ECR (node IAM handles it)
GKE → Artifact Registry (node SA handles it)

Q7: Where do image pull credentials live?

One of three places:
Cloud IAM (preferred)
Node IAM role (EKS)
Node pool service account (GKE)

Kubernetes Secret
imagePullSecret

Workload Identity / IRSA (advanced)
Pod-bound cloud identity

If you don’t know where your credentials are, that’s your bug.

Q8: Why does Kubernetes keep retrying image pulls?
Because Kubernetes assumes the failure might be temporary.

It retries with exponential backoff until:
the image becomes available
permissions are fixed
or the Pod is deleted

This is why you’ll see:
Pulling image...
Failed to pull image...
Back-off pulling image...

Q9: How do I know which registry Kubernetes is trying to pull from?

Run:
kubectl get pod <pod> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].image}'

Then:
read the registry hostname
confirm permissions for that registry

Q10: How do I debug image pull failures correctly?
Always start with:
kubectl describe pod <pod>

Then ask:
Does the image name exist?
Is it public or private?
What identity is pulling it?
Does that identity have permission?
If you skip these questions, you will waste time.


Q11: Does kubectl apply pull the image?
No.

kubectl apply:
sends YAML to the API server
does not touch images
does not validate registry access

Image pulling happens later, on the node.


Q12: What’s the fastest way to prove it’s a permission issue?
Look for these messages in describe pod:

pull access denied
unauthorized
no basic auth credentials

Those messages mean:
“The registry rejected the node’s identity.”

Q13: Can I test image pulling from a node directly?
Conceptually yes (not always practically in managed clusters).
If you could SSH into the node:

docker pull <image>

If that fails there, Kubernetes will fail too.

Q14: Why does Kubernetes not tell me “permission denied” clearly?
Because Kubernetes doesn’t own registry auth.

The error comes from:
Docker
containerd
the registry itself

Kubernetes just reports what it hears.

Q15: What is the single most important thing to remember?
Nodes pull images, using an identity.
If you remember nothing else, remember that.
